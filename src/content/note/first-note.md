This is my very first note on **ThoughtLite** ðŸŒ¿

Itâ€™s written in Markdown, and will appear automatically on the homepage once deployed.

You can write normally â€” paragraphs, lists, quotes, etc.

> Tip: All notes live inside `/src/content/notes/`.
> You can later sync this with your **Logseq** folder for automatic publishing.
