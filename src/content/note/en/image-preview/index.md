This article demonstrates three ways to reference images in Markdown.

## Relative Path

> [!NOTE]
> This approach is recommended as it helps with content organization and management, while Astro will optimize the images.

Using an image file from the same directory[^boat]:

## Absolute Path

Using an image file from the `/public` directory:

## External Image Hosting

Using an image from an external URL[^random]:
